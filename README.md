# PCALipids

Principal components analysis is a standart approach to study conformational changes in biological molecules, in particular when the free energy lanscape has only 1 sharp local minima. PCAlipids is a python based software that performs complete quantitative analysis of conformations and dynamics of lipids or other small molecules. All the information about the approach could be found in the following papers:

* [Principal Component Analysis of Lipid Molecule Conformational Changes in Molecular Dynamics Simulations, Buslaev et al., JCTC 2016](doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.5b01106)
* [Effects of Coarse Graining and Saturation of Hydrocarbon Chains on Structure and Dynamics of Simulated Lipid Molecules, Buslaev & Gushchin, Sci. Rep. 2017](doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-11761-5)

You could find the information on installation and a brief tutorial [here](https://github.com/membrane-systems/PCAlipids/blob/master/tutorial/tutorial.md).
